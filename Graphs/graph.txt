1.Directed Graph
   directed edge (uni or bi)
   Cyclic or acyclic(DAG)

2.Undirected Graph
   Bidirectional edge

Path : Node can't appear twice in path

Degree Of Graph :
	For unidirected : no. of edges connected to it
	                  2*E (E -> No. of nodes)
    For directed : 
    (a)Indegree : No. of edges going inside node
    (b)Outdegree: No. of edges going outside from node

Weights :
default one


DAG --> directed graph in a single direction without forming cycles in it

Bipartite Graph
   Graph in which we can color all its nodes using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have same color

   Linear graph (with no cycle) are always bipartite

   Any graph with even cycle length is bipartite
   -- | -- | -- | odd cycle length is not bipartite
