1.Directed Graph
   directed edge (uni or bi)
   Cyclic or acyclic(DAG)

2.Undirected Graph
   Bidirectional edge

Path : Node can't appear twice in path

Degree Of Graph :
	For unidirected : no. of edges connected to it
	                  2*E (E -> No. of nodes)
    For directed : 
    (a)Indegree : No. of edges going inside node
    (b)Outdegree: No. of edges going outside from node

Weights :
default one
