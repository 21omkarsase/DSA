// Spanning Tree
		// it has n nodes and n - 1 edges and 
		// each node is reachable by every other nodes

// Minimum Spanning Tree
		//Spanning tree with least sum of all edge weights

		//to draw mst
			// choose edge with minimum weight and select next edge adjacent to current edge having least edge weight among all adjancent edges.
			// repeat the process
