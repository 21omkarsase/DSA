Basic Information:

    Unordered Multimap is an associative container in C++ STL that allows multiple values to be associated with a single key.
    It stores elements in an unordered manner using a hash table-based data structure.
    Unordered Multimap does not maintain any specific order of its elements.

Memory Allocation:

    The memory for Unordered Multimap is dynamically allocated and managed internally by the container.
    The container automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation as elements are added or removed.

Implementation:

    Unordered Multimap is typically implemented using a hash table or hash map data structure.
    It uses a hash function to convert the keys into hash values, which determine the index or bucket where the elements are stored.
    Collision handling techniques such as chaining or open addressing are employed to handle situations where multiple elements have the same hash value.

Background:

    Unordered Multimap was introduced as part of the C++11 standard to provide efficient lookup and insertion operations for large datasets.
    It is designed to provide constant-time average complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Built-in Functions:

    Element Access:
        None. Unordered Multimap does not provide direct access to elements by index.

    Capacity:

        size():
            Returns the number of elements in the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.size()
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        empty():
            Checks if the unordered multimap is empty.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.empty()
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
            Space Complexity: O(1)

    Modifiers:

        insert():
            Inserts elements into the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.insert({key, value}) or unordered_multimap_name.insert(make_pair(key, value))
            Time Complexity: Average constant time O(1) for each insertion, but can be linear time O(n) in worst case if rehashing occurs.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        erase():
            Removes elements from the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.erase(key) or unordered_multimap_name.erase(iterator_position) or unordered_multimap_name.erase(iterator_start, iterator_end)
            Time Complexity: Average constant time O(1) for each erasure, but can be linear time O(n) in worst case if rehashing occurs.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        clear():
            Removes all elements from the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.clear()
            Time Complexity: Linear time O(n), where n is the number of elements in the unordered multimap.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

    Lookup:

        find():
            Searches for elements with a specified key in the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.find(key)
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1) on average, but linear time O(n) in worst case if many elements have the same key.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        count():
            Counts the number of elements with a specified key in the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.count(key)
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1) on average, but linear time O(n) in worst case if many elements have the same key.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        equal_range():
            Returns a pair of iterators representing the range of elements with a specified key in the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.equal_range(key)
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1) on average, but linear time O(n) in worst case if many elements have the same key.
            Space Complexity: O(1)

    Iterator Operations:

        begin():
            Returns an iterator pointing to the beginning of the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.begin()
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
            Space Complexity: O(1)

        end():
            Returns an iterator pointing to the end of the unordered multimap.
            Syntax: unordered_multimap_name.end()
            Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
            Space Complexity: O(1)


When to Use:

    Unordered Multimap is useful in scenarios where you need to store and retrieve multiple values associated with the same key efficiently.
    It is suitable when the order of elements does not matter, and fast lookup based on keys is required.
    It is commonly used in scenarios such as indexing, caching, and building hash-based data structures.

Pros:

    Fast average time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations (constant-time complexity).
    Efficient for large datasets and scenarios where fast lookup is important.
    Allows multiple values to be associated with a single key.
    Dynamic memory management handled by the container.

Cons:

    No specific order of elements is maintained.
    Slightly higher memory overhead compared to some other containers.
    Not suitable if maintaining the order of elements is required.
    Iteration over elements may not follow a specific order.
