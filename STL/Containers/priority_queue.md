Basic Information:
    A priority queue is an abstract data type that stores elements with associated priorities. It allows for efficient retrieval of the element with the highest (or lowest) priority. In a priority queue, elements are not stored in a specific order like in a regular queue or stack.

Memory Allocation:
    Priority queues are typically implemented using a data structure called a heap. The heap is usually implemented as an array, where each element represents a node in a binary tree. The memory allocation for a priority queue depends on the underlying implementation, but it typically requires additional memory for the array or linked structure used to represent the heap.

Implementation:
    Priority queues are commonly implemented using a binary heap or a variation of a binary heap, such as a binary max heap or a binary min heap. The binary heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property: for a max heap, the parent node has a higher priority than its children, while for a min heap, the parent node has a lower priority than its children. The heap structure allows efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element.

Background:
    The concept of a priority queue dates back to the 1960s. It was first introduced by J. W. J. Williams and refined by C. A. R. Hoare. Since then, priority queues have become a fundamental data structure in computer science, used in various algorithms and applications.

Functions:
    Element Access:

    top():
        Returns a reference to the highest-priority element in the priority queue.
        Syntax: priority_queue.top()
        Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
        Space Complexity: O(1)

    Capacity:

    empty():
        Checks if the priority queue is empty.
        Syntax: priority_queue.empty()
        Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
        Space Complexity: O(1)

    size():
        Returns the number of elements in the priority queue.
        Syntax: priority_queue.size()
        Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
        Space Complexity: O(1)

    Modifiers:

    push():
        Inserts an element into the priority queue.
        Syntax: priority_queue.push(value)
        Time Complexity: Logarithmic time O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue
        Space Complexity: O(1)

    pop():
        Removes the highest-priority element from the priority queue.
        Syntax: priority_queue.pop()
        Time Complexity: Logarithmic time O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue
        Space Complexity: O(1)

    swap():
        Swaps the contents of two priority queues.
        Syntax: priority_queue1.swap(priority_queue2)
        Time Complexity: Constant time O(1)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        
When to Use:
Priority queues are useful when you need to process elements based on their priority. Some common use cases include:

    Job scheduling: Prioritizing tasks based on urgency or importance.
    Event-driven simulations: Processing events based on their scheduled time.
    Graph algorithms: Implementing algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Prim's algorithm, where vertices or edges are processed based on their weights.

Pros:

    Efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element.
    Constant time complexity for insertion and deletion of elements.
    Can be used to implement various algorithms efficiently.

Cons:

    The priority queue does not provide direct access to elements based on their position.
    The ordering of elements is based solely on their priorities, not their actual values.
    The underlying heap structure may require additional memory overhead.
    Modifying the priority of an element or removing a specific element can be less efficient compared to other data structures like a balanced binary search tree.
