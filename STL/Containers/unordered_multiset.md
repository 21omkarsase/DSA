Unordered Multiset is a container provided by the C++ Standard Library that allows storage of multiple elements with no particular order and allows duplicate elements. It is implemented as an unordered associative container using a hash table.

Memory Allocation:

    Unordered Multiset allocates memory dynamically to store its elements. It internally manages a dynamic array of buckets, where each bucket is capable of holding multiple elements.
    The number of buckets is automatically adjusted by the container to accommodate the number of elements and ensure efficient lookup and insertion operations.

Implementation:

    Unordered Multiset is typically implemented using a hash table, where each element is hashed to determine its position within the table.
    The hash table consists of an array of linked lists or vectors, with each element being stored in the linked list or vector corresponding to its hash value.
    When an element is inserted, its hash value is computed, and it is inserted into the corresponding linked list or vector.
    To handle collisions (cases where multiple elements hash to the same position), the container uses a collision resolution mechanism such as separate chaining or open addressing.

Background:

    Unordered Multiset was introduced in C++11 as part of the Standard Template Library (STL).
    It provides an efficient way to store and retrieve elements when the order is not important, and duplicate elements are allowed.
    The use of hash tables allows for constant-time average complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Functions:

    Element Access:
        There are no specific built-in functions to access elements by index or position in an std::unordered_multiset. Since the elements are not stored in a specific order, direct access by index is not supported.

    Capacity:
        size(): Returns the number of elements in the unordered_multiset.
        empty(): Checks if the unordered_multiset is empty.
        max_size(): Returns the maximum number of elements the unordered_multiset can hold.

    Modifiers:
        insert(): Inserts an element into the unordered_multiset.
        erase(): Removes elements from the unordered_multiset by value or range.
        clear(): Removes all elements from the unordered_multiset.
        swap(): Swaps the contents of two unordered_multiset containers.

    Lookup:
        count(): Returns the number of elements with a specific value.
        find(): Searches for an element with a specific value.
        equal_range(): Returns a range containing all elements with a specific value.

    Bucket Interface:
        bucket_count(): Returns the number of buckets in the unordered_multiset.
        max_bucket_count(): Returns the maximum number of buckets the unordered_multiset can have.
        bucket_size(): Returns the number of elements in a specific bucket.
        bucket(): Returns the bucket number where a specific element is located.

    Hash Policy:
        load_factor(): Returns the current load factor of the unordered_multiset.
        max_load_factor(): Returns the maximum load factor of the unordered_multiset.
        rehash(): Sets the number of buckets to match a specified load factor.

    Iterator Operations:
        begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the beginning of the unordered_multiset.
        end(): Returns an iterator pointing to the end (one past the last element) of the unordered_multiset.
        cbegin(): Returns a constant iterator pointing to the beginning of the unordered_multiset.
        cend(): Returns a constant iterator pointing to the end (one past the last element) of the unordered_multiset.
        
When to Use Unordered Multiset:

    Unordered Multiset is suitable when you need to store multiple elements with no specific order and allow duplicates.
    It is useful in scenarios where you need to perform fast lookups based on element values rather than their order.
    It is commonly used in applications that require efficient membership testing, counting occurrences of elements, or tracking frequencies of elements.

Pros of Unordered Multiset:

    Fast average constant-time complexity (O(1)) for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
    Efficient for handling large amounts of data and performing lookup operations based on element values.
    Supports duplicate elements, allowing you to store multiple occurrences of the same value.

Cons of Unordered Multiset:

    No inherent order of elements, as they are stored based on their hash values.
    Iteration over the elements may not follow a specific order, which can be a drawback in certain scenarios.
    The space complexity can be higher compared to other containers due to the overhead of maintaining the hash table structure.
