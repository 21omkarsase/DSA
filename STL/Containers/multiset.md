Basic Information:
    A multiset is an associative container in C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that stores a collection of elements in which each element can appear multiple times. It is similar to a set, but allows duplicate elements. The elements in a multiset are typically sorted in a specific order determined by a comparison function.

Memory Allocation:
    A multiset dynamically allocates memory to store its elements. The memory allocation is handled internally by the container and automatically adjusts as elements are inserted or erased. The exact implementation details may vary across different compilers and platforms.

Implementation:
    The multiset is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree, such as a Red-Black Tree or an AVL Tree. These tree structures allow efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations while maintaining the elements in a sorted order. The specific implementation details are encapsulated within the C++ STL library.

Background:
    The multiset container is part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and has been available since the early versions of the language. It provides a convenient way to store and manipulate collections of elements that allow duplicates. The multiset is based on the mathematical concept of a multiset or a bag, which is a set that allows repeated elements.

When to Use:
You can use a multiset in various scenarios, including:

    When you need to store a collection of elements where duplicates are allowed.
    When you want to maintain the elements in sorted order according to a specific criterion.
    When you need efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations on the elements.

Pros of Multiset:

    Allows duplicate elements, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
    Maintains elements in sorted order, making it efficient for ordered traversal.
    Provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations with logarithmic time complexity.
    Supports various operations and algorithms provided by the C++ STL, making it convenient to work with.

Cons of Multiset:

    Takes more memory compared to a set due to storing duplicate elements.
    The sorted order imposes a performance overhead during insertion and deletion operations.
    The comparison function used to maintain the order can make the container less flexible in certain cases.
    The complexity of the operations can be higher compared to unordered containers in some scenarios.
